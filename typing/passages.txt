AI should enhance humanity, not replace it. The future depends not just on machines, but on the people who build, guide, and govern them with care, caution, and conscience.

The sky darkened, and thunder echoed across the valley. Raindrops pelted the windows like tiny drums. Inside the cabin, she lit a candle and waited.

When the storm passed, silence returned, broken only by birdsong and dripping eaves. The storm had left behind puddles, broken branches, and a sense of calm. Life was like that—sometimes loud and violent, but always followed by moments of quiet reflection.
